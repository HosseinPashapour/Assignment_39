<img src="Output\The_Tragedy_April.png" width="450">

we found out from top tables and diagram in April the store couldnt attract enough new customer. beside this old customers or existing customers didnt buy 
enough item in April. So if the store want the April experience wont repeate, the owner must apply a new policy to get new customers or make the old customers buy
more things.
